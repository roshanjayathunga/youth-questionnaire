        <p><b>Dear Parent ,</b></p>
        <p>Please note that the “Power World Sports Talent” report provides results by comparing your
          child’s physical attributes information, against 20 sports. It predicts your 12 or 13year-old
          child’s true sports talent once they are physically mature (fully physically grown) and ready
          to compete at the highest age groups in school. </p>

        <p class="sub-item">1. Kindly help your child answer the following questions as accurately as possible.</p>
        <p class="sub-item">2. The following activities mentioned below, your child might have taken part in or may
          have not. If they have, then please answer them based on their experience. If not, let them
          imagine that if all their classmates (of the same gender) took part in such a competition,
          what would their position or rank be, for each of the activities?
        </p>
        <p class="sub-item">3. Be as honest and accurate as possible to help us arrive at the most accurate assessment
          possible of your child’s sport talent.
        </p>
